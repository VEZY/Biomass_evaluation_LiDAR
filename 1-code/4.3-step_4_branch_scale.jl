# Step 4: branches volume and biomass prediction

## Inroduction

The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate the estimation of the branches volume and biomass using different methods.

## Material and methods

### Measurements

Two branches from three walnut trees (*Juglans nigra*) were studied in an agroforestry system. Two branches were identified per tree, one close to the ground, and one upper in the tree canopy. The branches were cut at the basis, and measured for their density, biomass, dimensions and topology:

- the fresh and dry density of 10 samples from sections along the first order axis were measured at the lab using the archimed method (measuring water displacement).

- The dimensions included a measurement of the diameter and length for each segment on the branch. They are used to compute a reference volume for each segment. See the previous notebook for more details (`4.2-step_2_check_manual_measurement.jl`).

- The fresh biomass was measured for the whole branch as soon as it is cut from the tree, and for each second order axis as a whole. The biomass of the first order axis is considered as the total branch biomass minus the cumulated biomass of the second order axis (A2), unless there are missing measurements for A2, in which case it is not used (*i.e.* tree13h and tree13l).

!!! warning
	The direct measurements of the whole-branch length, volume and biomass are biased because there was some structure loss due to cutting and wind.

### Computations

Several methods were used to estimate the cross-section of each segment in a branch:

- the pipe model. This method divide the parent cross-section to its children, weighted by the total number of terminal segments each child holds compared to its siblings.
- the pipe model applied to all segments below 20mm diameter. This method is the same as the regular pipe model but considers all segments with a diameter higher than 20mm as well-measured by the LiDAR, and start computing the cross-section only below this given threshold.
- the statistical model, applied to all segments. The model is fitted on the manual measurements of the branches, and applied to the plantscan3d MTG from LiDAR data.
- the statistical model applied to segments below 20mm diameter. This is the same strategy as for the pipe model.

The length estimated using no corrections at all on the MTG produced by plantscan3d (raw) seems closer to the direct measurement. However we know it is not really the case, and that it is essentially coming from an error compensation. The corrected MTG from plantscan3d tends to over-estimate the length, because several elements were broken, even before the direct measurement.

### Plots at branch scale, cor. as reference

The statistical model computation presents the closest estimations compared to the axis-scale measurements. We can then use it as a reference here to see how much error is added when used on the raw MTG outputed from plantscan3d. We can also compare the outputs from the pipe model to see if it is consistant with its predictions on the corrected MTG too.

## Discussion

Our results show that the pipe model and even the estimation from plantscan3d are closer to the direct measurement. However, it is important to note that a fair part of the error comes from the tree11h branch in particular, which had many broken structures before the direct measurement, hence we expect an overestimation from the LiDAR estimation.

!!! warning
	Branch tree11h has a consequent structure missing from the direct measurements (see S26 on A1).

It is difficult to know which method is best when the branches are not exactly comparable between the direct and indirect measurement. It is then preferable to evaluate the methods at axis scale (see next notebook: `4.3-step_4_axis_scale.jl`).
