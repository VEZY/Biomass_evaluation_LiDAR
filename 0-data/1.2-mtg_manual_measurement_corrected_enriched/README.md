# Corrected manual MTG data with IDs - enriched

This folder is the same as `0-data/1.1-mtg_manual_measurement_corrected_id`, but the MTGs were enriched with several new attributes potentially used as explanatory variables for the statistical model (see `1-code/2-model_diameter.jl`).

For further details about the files, see this [README.md](../1.0-mtg_manual_measurement_corrected/README.md) and this [README.md](../1.1-mtg_manual_measurement_corrected_id/README.md).
