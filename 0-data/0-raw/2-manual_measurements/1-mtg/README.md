# Manually measured MTGs

This folder contains the MTG files used to manually measure branches topology and dimensions. There are either `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` files. The former are standard excel files with the MTG, and the latter is the same but it contains an excel macro that ease the creation of new axis and segments. `ArchiMacro.xlsm` is a template file for that matter.

The tree1h, 1l 3h and 3l branches were measured in 2020 during the internship of M. Millan. There is no LiDAR measurement for these branches. They are primarily used for model training.

The 11, 12, 13 h&l were measured in 2021 during the internship of A. Bonnet. These branches were also scanned with the LiDAR. They are used for model training and validation.

The l and h suffixes denote the low and high branches. The low branch is the closest to the ground, and the high branch is upper in the tree canopy.
