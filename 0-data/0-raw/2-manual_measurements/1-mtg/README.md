# Manually measured MTGs

This folder contains the MTG files used to manually measure branches topology and dimensions. There are either `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` files. The former are standard excel files with the MTG, and the latter is the same but it contains an excel macro that ease the creation of new axis and segments. `ArchiMacro.xlsm` is a template file.

Trees 11, 12, 13 h&l were measured in 2021 during the internship of A. Bonnet. These branches were also scanned with a Riscan VZ-400 lidar.

The l and h suffixes denote the low and high branches. The low branch is the closest to the ground, and the high branch is upper in the tree canopy.
