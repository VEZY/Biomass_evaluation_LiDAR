# Wood density data

The two files correspond to the measurement of the branches samples volume, fresh and dry mass to compute the wood fresh and dry density. Approximately 101 samples were collected along the order 1 axis of each branch during the 2021 campaign.

`sample-data-2-branches-juin.csv` is the data for tree11l and tree11h (june 2021), and `sample-data-4-branches-avril.csv` is the data for tree12l&h, and tree13l&h (april 2021).
