# Corrected manual MTG data

## Introduction

This folder contains the `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` (the ones with the macro) files used to describe the branches MTG measured on the field. These versions differs from the version in `0-raw/2-manual_measurements/1-mtg` because they are corrected from any mistakes made on the field, *e.g.* clear unit mistake (*e.g.* cm instead of mm during tape measurement), missing segments for some broken axis, data outside of the attributes columns...

## Metadata

`metadata.csv` is the excel file where all attributes are described, including their units.
