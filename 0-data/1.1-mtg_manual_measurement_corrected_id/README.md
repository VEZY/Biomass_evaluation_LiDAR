# Corrected manual MTG data with IDs

This folder is the same as `0-data/1.0-mtg_manual_measurement_corrected`, but the MTGs were enriched with a new attribute: id. This id helps make a correspondance between the manually measured MTG and the MTG computed from the LiDAR data. Each axis was manually searched in both MTGs, and axis with clear correpondance were given a unique ID.

For further details about the files, see this [README.md](../1.0-mtg_manual_measurement_corrected/README.md).
