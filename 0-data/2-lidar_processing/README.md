# LiDAR processing

This folder contains three sub-folders related to LiDAR point-cloud processing.

## 1. Isolations per scan

This folder contains the lidar data for each scan position. The data is divided into two sub-folders: `1-trees` and `2-branches`. The former contains the point clouds of the whole trees, and the latter contains the point clouds filtered to get only the target branches.

## 2. Grouped point clouds

This folder contains the point clouds grouped into a single file for each tree and branch. The data is divided into two sub-folders: `1-trees` and `2-branches`. The former contains the point clouds of the whole trees, and the latter contains the point clouds filtered to get only the target branches.

## 3. Scans positions

This folder contains the scan positions data. The data is stored in a single file called `scan_positions.csv`.
